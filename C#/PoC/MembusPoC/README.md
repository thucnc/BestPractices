Our living world always has 2 ways of communication: active vs passive, request-response vs pub-sub. Same does programming. However, I found that we often use request-response approach in .NET back-end programming which brings us some disavantages later such as hard maintenance and modification. For instance, we want to add some more logic, handling into our current process, then in normal sense with the current approach, we need to inject code in our legacy code. On the other hands, in a specific domain business, we need to treat our objects as real entities, or in other words, they have their own events and behaviors. If we can distinguish domain events with our infrastructure events/calls, it would be very benificial to code quality. Just imagine, we have some important domain events like SomethingBegined, SomeThingFinished, etc.. then now, when they happened, we want all associated event handlers will handle these events. If we desire to add more logic, we add more domain event handlers. This approach is very alike to delegate or servicebus patterns, but the former is quite limited to function, quite the latter is too complicated. So I just want a just-in-time solution - a lean in-memory message bus following pub-sub mechanism that can dispatch all relevant event handler classes to a specific domain events.
This project is to evaluate a nuget package called MemBus on my above requirements.
